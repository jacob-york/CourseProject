I implemented this with Maven, and wrote it so database.txt is in the resources folder.
If you're using Maven, it just needs to go in there.
The easiest way to do it I think would be to just clone this repo.
However, if you really need to change it, then you'd need to change how ConnectionManager gets the database file in
```getFileFromResources()```.

other than that, just have the host IP ready for whatever machine is running the server. You paste it into the client
console to establish a connection over port 81.
