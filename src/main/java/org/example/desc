input to server (query):
    query message w/ an email address

output to client:
    full name associated



I'm starting with the Example clients and servers as templates.
There are a few things I need to get out of the way in the beginning:
    > I need to write a getName() method on the server-side, which takes an email address string as input and outputs the
      associated name according to database.txt.
    > I need support for multiple clients.
